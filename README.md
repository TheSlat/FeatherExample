# Boilerplate Feather M0 Project
Boilerplate project for using Atmel Start (ASF4) on the Adafruit Feather M0 with either C or C++11
The CPPPROJ file was manually created by merging  an atmel start CPROJ file with a new c++ project file, but once done atmel start seems to work fine, and reconfigure if needed using the built in GUI.
All pins and names are set up to use the feathers default names and uses (SPI, I2C, etc)
